The Tango Gameshow Challenge

A simple React app that will execute the following game show 2000 times!

There exist three boxes, one of which contain the prize.
Step 1) A user picks one out of three boxes
Step 2) One of the other two boxes, which does not contain the prize is removed
Step 3) The user has the option to switch their box with the final remaining box
Step 4) The user opens their box to potentially get the reward

This app was built as a solution to Tango's challenge problem.
